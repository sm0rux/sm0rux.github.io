I'm Pontus Falk, living in Stockholm, Sweden. SM0RUX is my ham radio callsign. I am a GnuPG and Signal user as I prefer e2e encryption when communicating with my friend.

== My projects on GitHub

=== Codeplugs for AnyTone DMR radios

I publiah two codeplugs for AnyTone DMR radios - one for [Anytone AT-D878UV](https://github.com/sm0rux/at-d878uv) and one for [Anytone AT-D578UV](https://github.com/sm0rux/at-d578uv).
The code plugs have all Swedish DMR and FM ham radio repeaters included as well as some DMR repeaters in Denmark, Finland and Norway. Feel fre to fork and create pull requests in case
you find any errors to help me maintain the files. In case you are not very familiar with GitHub you can also create issues, a very simple process for GitHub rookies.

You find more info about the code plugs [here](https://sm0rux.github.io/anytone.html).

=== A simple GitHub tutorial

[Here](https://sm0rux.github.io/git.html) you find a very simple and easy-to-follow GitHub tutorial.

== Why I publish my projects?

I truly believe in free and libre open source software. Files I would create for myself I publish and if just one of you out there find my files usefull I'm very happy!
